Notes Qt - Hierarchical Note Application
==========================================

Notes Qt is an innovative note-taking application that allows you to organize information in a flexible, hierarchical tree structure. The application is entirely developed in Python and uses the modern `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`__ framework to provide an attractive, cross-platform user interface.

- **Rich Text Formatting:**  
    Style your notes with a variety of formatting options, similar to popular word processors like Word.

- **Integrated Drawings:**  
    In addition to plain text content, Notes Qt supports the embedding of drawings, allowing you to capture ideas visually.

    Quickly find the desired contentâ€”the search function allows you to search notes for text segments or keywords.
